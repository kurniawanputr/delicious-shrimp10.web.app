If you love shrimp (and aren&#39;t allergic) then I must highly suggest that you make your own homemade shrimp stock for your next seafood-y soup or risotto. Rinse the shrimp shells under cold running water and place them in a stockpot with the shrimp shells, onion, carrots, celery, garlic, bay. Many scampi recipes involve cooking the shrimp with the other ingredients. You can do that here, too, but the benefit of cooking the shrimp separately is twofold: it&#39;s easier not to overcook them. Don&#39;t throw away leftover shrimp shells.
