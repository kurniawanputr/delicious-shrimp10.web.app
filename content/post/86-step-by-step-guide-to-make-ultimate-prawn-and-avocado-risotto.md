recipeingredient:
- "Dash olive oil"
- "1 teaspoon butter"
- "1 onion diced"
- "3 cloves garlic thinly diced"
- "2 teaspoons dried thyme"
- "1 and 12 cups Aborio rice or risotto rice"
- "1/2 cup dry white wine"
- "6 cups hot vegetable stock"
- "500 grams shelled drained prawn meat"
- "1/4 teaspoon ground saffron"
- "to taste Saltpepper"
- "2 very ripe avocados sliced"
- " Parmasen to serve"
recipeinstructions:
- "On the stovetop, heat oil and butter on a low heat and cook your onion and garlic until fragrent"
- "In the meantime, in a separate pot, boil you stock. When boiled, lower heat to keep stock on a low rolling boil."
- "Place in the rice and thyme in with the onion + garlic. Stir for 3-4 minutes. Increase temperature to med/high heat and pour in wine stirring continuously."
- "When wine is absorbed, add 1 X ladle of your hot stock. Stir through until absorbed. Repeat until you have 2 X ladles of stock left in reserve. Although this takes a little bit of time, there is no way to rush this - adding too much stock before absorption can lead to mushy rice."

- "When you have used all you stock, your prawns should be cooked. Although this may vary depending on prawn size. Cut one open to check + cook longer of necessary."
- "When you have confirmed prawns are cooked, sample, and adjust for salt (if home-made/low sodium vegetable stock was used) and pepper."
- "Serve into bowls and top with sliced avocado and parmesan cheese. Mix avocado through with your fork and enjoy!"
